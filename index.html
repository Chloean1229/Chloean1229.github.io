    <h2>From 2020 to Now</h2>
   

    <p>
        Now I am in my first semester of the Strategic Product Design. 
        Before college I was full of desire to create beautiful things, making models and painting was a process of creating beauty. 
        This is what design brings to me initially. Then I majored in product design in my undergraduate studies. 
        After doing some design projects, I realized that design is not just 
        about looking good, it aims to solve practical problems. I also found 
        that in many cases a perfect product alone cannot solve complex 
        issues as design is connected to so many disciplines. It is necessary 
        to stand on a more systematic and long-term perspective, such as 
        strategic design or service design, to come up with design solutions 
        and seek collaboration with other stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last year, I came to know the concept of T-type Talent when I listened to a lecture. 
        If the learning of the undergraduate phase equipped me with “|” (i.e. the research of Product Design itself and its involving fields), 
        then I hope to also have “-”. In this way, I will be able to gain access to more broad knowledge about service design, 
        sociology and commercial strategy, so as to design works with an eye to the interests of the whole.
